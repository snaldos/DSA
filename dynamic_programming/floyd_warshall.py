def floyd_warshall(graph):
    """
    Computes the shortest distances between every pair of vertices in the graph using the Floydâ€“Warshall algorithm.

    Parameters:
        graph (list of lists): A 2D list where graph[i][j] is the weight of the edge from i to j,
                               or float('inf') if no such edge exists. A zero on the diagonal implies
                               no self-loop cost.

    Returns:
        list of lists: A 2D list where the entry at [i][j] is the minimum distance from vertex i to vertex j.
