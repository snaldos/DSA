def transitive_closure(graph):
    """
    Computes the transitive closure of a directed graph using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.

    Parameters:
        graph (list of lists): A 2D list where graph[i][j] is True if there is a direct edge from i to j,
                                or False if no such edge exists. A zero on the diagonal implies
                                no self-loop cost.

    Returns:
        list of lists: A 2D list where the entry at [i][j] is True if there is a path from vertex i to vertex j.
